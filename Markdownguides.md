This [Macdown tutorial] (https://github.com/MacDownApp/macdown/blob/master/MacDown/Resources/help.md)  proved to be the best one I could find. I used it for almost the entire project. I would rank this as #1. It was easy enough to follow and had images of what should be happening. 

This [video tutorial] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HndN6P9ke6U) was also very helpful. I especially liked this one because I was having a hard time figuring out how to insert images into Macdown. This tutorial showed what and where to type to get results. I rank this as my #2 choice. 

This [Markdown] (https://alvinalexander.com/markdown-cheat-sheet) tutorial was another helpful guide. It had very precise instructions and directions that help guide what to do next. I rank this as my #3 choice. 

This Markdown [guide] (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) was pretty good as well. It helps get a feel of what Markdown looks like. I didn't really use this for myself because there are slight differences with Macdown. But for getting a general idea of what Markdown is all about, it does its job. I rank this one #4. 


[This] (https://commonmark.org/help/) tutorial is a little on the short end as far as getting information across to the audience. Although it is very simple, I feel that if someone was having trouble figuring it out, they would easily give up. I do praise it for its simplicity with, a "doing this, gets that" kind of process. I rank this one as #5.
