- When we were assigned the task of creating a lego project I
had no idea what to make. Reflecting to what I usually did with lego
I dove into a box searching for a single piece for inspiration. I think
it was one of the yellow angled pieces that made me think of a backboard
on a stove. I wasn't sure how I could make it at the time, but I was 
determined to find pieces to make it possible. Luckily the three yellow
pieces for the backboard were all together so it was just creating the 
body and finding the burner pieces that took the most time to find. When
I had all the pieces needed I quickly put it together to make sure that
it would work. Then after giving it a good lookover I took it all apart,
remembering where each piece went while doing so.
  Then I got set to making the instructions. I decided to make it into simple 
and brief steps. In the steps I tried to be as specific as possible but 
at the same time word it in a way that most could understand. For each 
step I decided to accompany the text with a visual aid. I decided to do 
that because I know from my experiences with instructions and manuals that
I appreciate when they include visual examples that help further describe
how to do the task at hand.
- In this classroom scenario, for this project my thought process has been
encouraged to think outside of what I would alone think. To think about
other possible perspectives. Having to consider what your audience might
think slows down the process of what one puts down as the finished product.
In this class the audience is fairly easy to recognize, all students who have
reached the 100 level english, and majority of them are younger rather than
older. I think that when you know that your audience is close to your age, 
you feel comfortable with the vocabulary you choose to present them with. I
haven't used any slang or jargon because it isn't formal for instructions,
but I think that if I did, many of them could pick up on the meaning. From
what I can gather from my audience is that they are visual learners, because
they are using Legos and that they have a desire to create something. 
- For this project I initially chose to present it in PowerPoint. I like 
PowerPoint becasue it has a looser more relaxed vibe to it compared to 
straight forward documents like Word or TextEdit. It is more of a presentation
for the audience to interact with. Slides also help move things along at a 
pace that can be presented at an understandable rate. Lumping everything
together can be overwhelming, and you can lose your audience. 
  After I learned that we also had the option to print our instructions out,
that became my choice of presenting. I am a fan of having physical copies of
just about everything I own, especially my music! So having the instructions
on paper was a no-brainer for me. This way there's no chance for some kind of
technical difficulties to occur that would cause panic or frustration. There's
also a more comfortable feeling having the power to hold the instructions in 
one's hands. I want my audience to be as comfortable as possible when creating,
and by them having their own copy of the instructions, I think they will be. 
- This week I have learned that there is so much I still don't know about 
technology. I've learned to just accept that and move forward regardless of 
where I am in knowing the deep fundimentals of tech. Such is the case with 
Markdown. Looking up Markdown, I felt like a rookie for sure. But the only 
way I can learn is to try. I downloaded MacDown and that came with a help guide
that I feel will help calm my worrying. I leanred that these programs are  made
to help people, so I'm sure the creators would want to help people learn the 
programs. I have to remind myself that it's possible to do, even for me.
