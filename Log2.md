- When we were assigned the task of creating a lego project I
had no idea what to make. Reflecting to what I usually did with lego
I dove into a box searching for a single piece for inspiration. I think
it was one of the yellow angled pieces that made me think of a backboard
on a stove. I wasn't sure how I could make it at the time, but I was 
determined to find pieces to make it possible. Luckily the three yellow
pieces for the backboard were all together so it was just creating the 
body and finding the burner pieces that took the most time to find. When
I had all the pieces needed I quickly put it together to make sure that
it would work. Then after giving it a good lookover I took it all apart,
remembering where each piece went while doing so.
  Then I got set to making the instructions. I decided to make it into simple 
and brief steps. In the steps I tried to be as specific as possible but 
at the same time word it in a way that most could understand. For each 
step I decided to accompany the text with a visual aid. I decided to do 
that because I know from my experiences with instructions and manuels that
I apprecieate when they include visual examples that help further describe
how to do the task at hand.
- In this classroom scenario, for this project my thought process has been
encouraged to think outside of what I would alone think. To think about
other possible perspectives. Having to consider what your audience might
think slows down the process of what one puts down as the finished product.
In this class the audience is fairly easy to recognize, all students who have
reached the 100 level english, and majority of them are younger rather than
older. I think that when you know that your audience is close to your age, 
you feel comfortable with the vocabulary you choose to present them with. I
haven't used any slang or jargon because it isn't formal for instructions,
but I think that if I did, many of them could pick up on the meaning.
