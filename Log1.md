- Hello, my name is Luke Rinehart. This is my fifth and last quarter at Pierce
College. I plan to graduate with my associate's degree this summer. I have
been accepted to University of Washington Tacoma and plan on attending
this coming fall. At University of Washington Tacoma I plan to enroll into
their technical communications program. My educational path has branched off
in many directions. For a couple years I was in the Bates Dental Lab Technician
program. Then I spent roughly a year in the medical assistant program at Clover
Park. I decided that neither technical programs were quite for me, so decided
to refocus and finish my associate's degree.
- From what I have come to understand, technical writing is geared towards
helping describe something so that people understand it. I believe that
it has to be precise, straightforward, and formal. The readings have aligned
pretty well with what I have thought technical writing is. What has been
solidified to what I thought, is that it is for an audience. A technical
writer needs to know the audience and work for them. It is well said in 
our reading with Kate Schneider. She summed up how it is the job of the 
technical writer to help the reader undertstand the content to the fullest.
-The GitHub tutorial went pretty smooth. Having another open tab with 
the instructions made it easier to go step by step to creating the account.
I noticed that the instructions were very simple and brief. There were also 
very helpful visual aids that helped in seeing what it looked like before
and after. Seeing the pictures really helped me keep on track, and not feel
overwhelmed with instructions. I think the key characteristics are that the
instructions are simple but precise and in brief steps. The instructions 
feature pictues that help the viewer understand immensely on what is happening.
