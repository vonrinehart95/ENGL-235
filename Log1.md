- Hello, my name is Luke Rinehart.
- From what I have come to understand, technical writing is geared towards
helping describe something so that people undeerstand it. I believe that
it has to be precise, straightforward, and formal. The readings have aligned
pretty well with what I have thought technical writing is. What has been
solidified to what I thought, is that it is for an audience. A technical
writer needs to know the audience and work for them. 
- The GitHub tutorial went pretty smooth. Having another open tab with 
the instructions made it easier to go step by step to creating the account.
I noticed that the instructions were very simple and brief.
