* This week the class continued work on the analytical report project. To me, *learning by example* is one of my favorite methods to fully understanding how to do something right. To see exactly how it looks in real life sometimes is so much easier to understand than reading in depth descriptions about it. This method is how I approached taking on the analytical report. The report is made up of different documents that are new to me. Documents like [transmittal letters] (http://web.mit.edu/course/21/21.guide/l-trans.htm) and [executive] (https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/executive-summary-examples) summaries were ones I needed to see to understand. 
  
  My Microsoft Word provided me with some cover pages to work with and one example included having a brief abstract on the cover. I found this interesting because it could have the potential to grab a reader's interest. Interested by this I asked Jason what he thought about it, we discussed the idea, and reached a conclusion. A cover page for an analytical report, an abstract would be a bit too much. I decided to use that template, but do skip the abstract portion. 
  
* Thursday, Forrest and myself looked at each other's rough drafts for the report. We both responded well to each other's work. We both found that we mainly needed to get the recommendations and proposals cleaned up and finished. Other than that, just some minor suggestions for changes like titles and placements. I talked with Mitch about placement of suggestions with the visuals and we discussed different ways that look good. I also discussed with Jason about not just having all the proposals and recommendations in one space, but sectioning them off with their respective data. I think that is a good approach because it gives the audience something to *look at* and *read*. 
* From between now and Monday I need to *finalize* my proposals/recommendations. Wording them and placing them in appropriate and straighforward ways. Once those are taken care of I can finish with final touches being the bibliography, appendices, and table of contents. I will also probably work off of the feedback a get from Jason on the rough draft I submitted. It is mainly the recommendations that will be the first priority. 
* This week I learned a good deal on what makes an analytical report. It has multiple parts that make it one report. I learned that I am very comfortable working off of examples. My [favorite] (http://sites.psu.edu/businesswritinglesliemateer/wp-content/uploads/sites/7885/2014/02/Danish_food_for_all_forever_report.pdf) example had everything I needed to see to understand how one of these reports looks in the real world. Figuring out the different contents of an analytical report really struck a chord with what I believe technical writing is. Information that is presented in a formal and straighforward manor for an audience.
