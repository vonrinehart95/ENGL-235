-  Composing a well done survey is not an easy task. Especially
in a large group. Creating a well crafted survey takes a good
amount of out of the box thinking. Your question might seem
perfectly sound to you, but to someone else it could be 
completely foreign. It deals a lot with thinking with different
perspectives. Collaberating with a large group is good because
it gives many perspectives but it takes longer to get an actual
product. Everyone has their own view, which ultimately helps in
creating a survey because we are all different thinkers. 
  The affect this work has is one that broadens our creative
writing process. By thinking about how the language may come
across to people in different ways, that helps narrow down how
we want to survey our audience. It is interesting because you 
start to think about what is neutral language, or how to phrase
something politely. Thinking and writing this way has raised my
awareness of how to work for an audience. How to best ask them
questions without offending, confusing, or boring them. 
- The audience for PierceHacker I believe is mainly the student
population at Pierce College. It could be for the faculty as
well. Although I believe that PierceHacker is public, so it is
available to whoever knows about it. The audience is not limited,
but focused on students at Pierce college. The purpose of Pierce
Hacker is to have a learning experience. It is to aid people in
enhancing their knowlege via technology. 
  I think Jason decided to deliver this program as a public site
because that way it could reach more people. It is free and there
is no membership or hoops to jump through in order to use it. I
believe he wants as many people as possible to benefit from the
public site. 
- This week I learned that collaborating and working in a large
group takes a lot of communication and time. We worked on the
survey together via Google docs, where we could all work 
simultaneously. Communication is key when working with anyone,
so it was important that the suggestions be discussed thoroughly.
I had worked in Google docs in small groups before, but never
this large, so that was a new experience. I was already fairly
comfortable with using the collaborative media, and after this
it has been increased as well. I learned that I need feedback 
to move on with my work, to keep the wheels in motion. That
means talking to people, which is something that can always
be improved. Group work needs communication to succeed.
